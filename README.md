# OvertimePolicies

A sample project developed for evaluating some of my abilities to coding Clean. It can be used as a Clean structure for some project types.

# Getting Started

To run and test the project you should:
. Download or clone the source code.
. Have Docker Desktop installed on your machine.
. Doanloed and run OvertimePoliciesDatabaseScript.sql to generate SQL Server database.
  Note - I use Database First for EFCore generation.
